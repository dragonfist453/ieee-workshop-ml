# Assignment for day 4

Given the datasets in the data folder of this repository. The assignment for day 2 is this:

 - A family may want to look for a house with a minimum number of rooms and bathrooms. Make a function that encapsulates this process, operating on the housing prices dataset and returning the filtered recordset.
 - We need to perform Random Forest Regression to predict house prices. The first step to this is shuffling the dataset. Using the housing data dataset, shuffle all its rows, and then add a row identifier `id` (Hint: Use RANDOM(), SORT and TRANSFORM)

 Answers for the assignment are the ecl files in the following folder

 - [X] filterset.ecl
 - [X] shuffle.ecl
